Easy Phish - write up

In this OSINT challenge the flag consits of two sub-flags hidden in the information you have to check.
To be able to fully understand the concept of this challenge we have to study how email impersonation works
by clicking the following link: https://blog.ironbastion.com.au/email-impersonation-scams-phishing-what-your-staff-can-do/

It is also important to know what SPF, DKIM and DMARC are:

After that we can start the challenge.

We first search for secure-startup.com in https://dnsdumpster.com/ and if we scroll down, we will find the first part of the
flag which is: HTB{RIP_SPF_Always_2nd
OR
We can actually find the first part of the flag by running: nslookup -type=txt secure-startup.com , in the linux terminal.

After that, we have to find the second part of the flag. To do that, we have to run: nslookup -type=txt _dmarc.secure-startup.com ,
or go to a site that runs dmarc requests. Thus we find the second part of the flag which is: _F1ddl3_2_DMARC}

So the flag we are after is: HTB{RIP_SPF_Always_2nd_F1ddl3_2_DMARC}
