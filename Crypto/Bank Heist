Bank Heist - writeup

If I was the one categorizing this challenge, I would not submit it under the category of easy, but rather
the medium challenges, as it has a lot of difficulties and needs a combination of hard thinking, adapting to real life
scenarios and some basic scripting. Without further ado, let's start with the write up.

After downloading and extracting the file bank_heist_message.txt, we open it and see a series of numbers.
Based on the scenario of the challenge, and as that this text was written in a flip phone, we start to decode
the message based on the diagram below:

-1. [special characters.. not needed for this challenge]
-2. [A][B][C]
-3. [D][E][F]
-4. [G][H][I]
-5. [J][K][L]
-6. [M][N][O]
-7. [P][Q][R][S]
-8. [T][U][V]
-9. [W][X][Y][Z]
-0. [_]

So if we press 3 times 4, we get "I", if we press 2 times 5, we get "K" etc.
After we decode the message either with a simple script or by hand, we get the following message:

\\IF YOU ARE READING THE CIPHER, YOU ARE OKAY. YOUR SHARE OF THE HEIST IS IN YOUR HOUSE. THE KEY TO
\\THE LOCK IS BELOW. GO TO PARIS.
\\GSV XLWV GL GSV HZU OLXP : TLIVGRIVNVMGUFMW!!

We still can't read the final line though which probably holds the flag for the challenge.
We have no more clues so we have to play the guessing game.

After some time, I thought GSV (which appears two times in the encoded message) stands for THE and tried to find
some connection between GSV and THE. I realised that there was a connection between their indexes in the alphabet list.

So:
G = 6 and T = 19. G + T = 6 + 19 = 25
S = 18 and H = 7. S + H = 18 + 7 = 25
V = 21 and E = 4. V + E = 21 + 4 = 25

So the message is encoded in a format similar to the Caesar Cipher one, where the sum of the indices of the encoded and
decoded letters is equal to 25.

Running the following basic python script, we get the result we want.

\\SCRIPT//

#!/bin/python3
alph = ['A','B','C','D','E','F','G','H','I','J','K','L','M','N','O','P','Q','R','S','T','U','V','W','X','Y','Z']
fl = "GSV XLWV GL GSV HZU OLXP TLIVGRIVNVMGUFMW"
un = fl.split()
message = ""
for word in un:
	for char in word:
		num = 25 - alph.index(char)
		message += alph[num]
	if word != "TLIVGRIVNVMGUFMW":
		message+=" "
	else:
		pass
message +="!!"
print(message)
flag_mess = message.split(" ")
flag = "HTB{"+flag_mess[len(flag_mess) - 1]+"}"
print("Flag: "+ flag)

\\SCRIPT//

The result we get from this script is:

THE CODE TO THE SAF LOCK GORETIREMENTFUND!!
Flag: HTB{GORETIREMENTFUND!!}

So by submtting the flag HTB{GORETIREMENTFUND!!} we complete the Bank Heist Challenge.
